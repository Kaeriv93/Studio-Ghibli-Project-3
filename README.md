# MVP
1. We will provide routes, so when a specific movie is clicked on we will be taken to that page.
Depending on which user is logged in, whenever we click on the user homepage it will take us to that specific user page.
2. We will implement a user registration feature and only allow users to be able to leave reviews on movies
3. We will have a user be able to only recommend ONE movie out of their favorite list and have it displayed within their biography.
4. Although simple, the complexity will revolve around us having to make sure that the users are connected to reviews which are connected to comments.
5. Not only will we be able to make sure that users are able to delete their own account but also make it so all reviews left by them are also deleted once their account is deleted.

# Stretch Goals
1. We like the implementation of SASS and want to get accustomed to using it. If not, then regular css should be sufficient.
2.  css animations. There is a specific feature where if you hover over a card-image or so it will flip over and display new content. I have seen this in a few e-commerce sites and think that it will add a lot of style to the application
3. search query that helps the user filter through movies.
OR use A-Z filters to filter between movies depending on the first character in the title
4. Allow the users to add each other as friends and they can visit their friends userPage ← Have an idea of how to maybe implement this but we shall see.
5. Allow for a dark/light mode
